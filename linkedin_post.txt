Excited to share a fun project I built: a web-based calculator! 🚀

This project was a great way to practice my front-end development skills. I used HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling, and JavaScript to make it interactive.

It's amazing how much you can do with just these three technologies. I'm looking forward to building more complex projects in the future!

Check out the code on my GitHub (link in comments) and let me know what you think!
